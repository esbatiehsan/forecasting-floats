# Forecasting Floats in Turbulence

Predicting complex interactions at the Ocean-Air interface has always been difficult. Features smaller than mesoscale (smaller than 5 kilometres in dimension) are often completely left out of predictions, while prediction of mesoscale features (between 5 and several hundred kilometres) often fail to produce reasonable accuracy.

Given this background, The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has set up a challenge to discover innovative solutions to incorporate Lagrangian drifters into ocean models and forecasts. The [Forecasting Floats in Turbulence](https://web.cvent.com/event/501b761d-7e68-4fc8-b0bb-53b8c7f79f34/summary) challenge aims to force competitors to consider the effects of turbulence and sub-mesoscale ocean features not usually found in today's ocean models. This research could potentially be used to improve maritime route planning, man-overboard recovery procedures, and even the way we respond in the event of an oil spill.

In this project, I will first analyse the data provided by DARPA, containing 20 days of drifter data. I will then implement a model to predict drifter position in subsequent days based on the effects of real-world winds and currents at the ocean-air interface.
